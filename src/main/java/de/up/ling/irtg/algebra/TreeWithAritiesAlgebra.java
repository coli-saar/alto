/**
 * A tree algebra in which the operation symbols are marked with their arities.
 * The <i>values</i> of this algebra are arbitrary trees, i.e. trees such as
 * <code>f(f(a), b)</code>. Note that f occurs twice in the tree: once with arity
 * 2 and once with arity 1. Such a tree would not be allowed as a term over
 * an algebra, which must be consistent with the ranked signature over the algebra,
 * so f can only have arity 1 or 2, but not both. Thus an ordinary {@link TreeAlgebra}
 * cannot represent this tree.<p>
 * 
 * The TreeWithAritiesAlgebra circumvents this problem by annotating every
 * operation symbol in the algebra with its arity, thus separating the
 * one-place and the two-place f into two different symbols. The (unique)
 * term in this algebra that evaluates to f(f(a),b) is <code>f_2(f_1(a_0), b_0)</code>.
 * Observe that each symbol has a suffix "_k", where k is the number of children
 * in the tree. These symbols disappear when then term is evaluated
 * to a tree.<p>
 * 
 * Many trees that arise in practice should be represented as values of this
 * algebra and not the {@link TreeAlgebra}. For instance, the parse trees in the
 * Penn Treebank have NP nodes with one children, two children, and so on.
 * Thus when you write a grammar that generates PTB-style parse trees,
 * you'll want to use a {@link TreeWithAritiesAlgebra} instead of a
 * {@link TreeAlgebra}.<p>
 * 
 * By default, this algebra is in <i>permissive mode</i> or not. In non-permissive mode,
 * when you try to evaluate a term like <code>f_2(a_0)</code>, evaluation will fail
 * with an {@link IllegalArgumentException}, because <code>f_2</code> should have
 * two children, but only got one. In permissive mode, such mismatches are ignored.
 * By default, the algebra is in permissive mode; this simplifies PTB parsing,
 * but has the theoretical problem that now not every term that evaluates to some
 * tree t is in the language of the decomposition automaton (because the latter only
 * accepts trees with the correct arities in the labels).
